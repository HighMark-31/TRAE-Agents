## 1. Starting with Core Components

The journey began by developing some **key foundational components**, including:  

- **Name** – The title of the agent.  
- **Applicable scenarios** – The specific use cases, tasks, or workflows where this agent can be applied.

## 2. Crafting Prompts with Smart Generate

Once the core components were ready, I moved on to designing **prompts for Smart Generate**:  

1. **Drafting:** I wrote the first versions of each prompt.  
2. **Translation:** Converted drafts into clear **English**, ensuring global compatibility.  
3. **AI Optimization:** Refined the prompts using **ChatGPT** to maximize accuracy and performance.  
4. **Manual Engineering:** Applied **structured prompt engineering** to further enhance logic, readability, and reliability.

This iterative process ensured that each prompt was precise, context-aware, and aligned with the agent’s intended behavior.

## 3. Testing & Validation

After generating the agents, I performed **extensive testing** to guarantee consistent and high-quality outputs:  

- **Test Rounds:**  
  - 5x requests per agent to **Gemini 3 Pro** and **GPT-5 High**.  
  - 10x requests per agent to **Gemini 2.5 Flash**.  

- **Optimization:**  
  Any suboptimal response triggered a refinement cycle where either the **prompt system** or the **project rules** were adjusted for better results.  

This rigorous testing phase ensured reliability, precision, and robustness across different models and scenarios.

## 4. Completion & Results

Through this structured workflow, **all agents were successfully created** and tested. Each agent now functions as a domain expert capable of:  

- Generating accurate and optimized code.  
- Performing advanced analysis and debugging.  
- Providing professional guidance in their respective domains.  

This methodology ensures that every TRAE Agent is not only functional but also highly reliable and ready for practical use.

## Summary

The combination of **core component design, iterative prompt engineering, and systematic testing** allowed for a comprehensive, professional suite of agents. This document can serve as a reference for future agent creation, optimization, or replication in similar AI-powered projects.
